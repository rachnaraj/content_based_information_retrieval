    can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more
    easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and
    sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a
    semiconductor material can be modified by doping, or by the application of
    electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used
