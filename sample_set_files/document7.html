    The history of the understanding of semiconductors begins with experiments
    on the electrical properties of materials. The properties of negative
    temperature coefficient of resistance, rectification, and light-sensitivity
    were observed starting in the early 19th century.

    classified solid materials as metals, insulators and "variable conductors"
in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term    <em>Halbleiter</em>(semiconductor in modern meaning) in PhD thesis in 1910.

    Agreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum

    Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying proportions of
    trace contaminants produced differing experimental results. This spurred
    the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in
    modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion
    purity.

    Devices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical
    knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided a guide to construction of
    more capable and reliable devices.
