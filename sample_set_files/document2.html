<p>Variable conductivity</p>

<p>Semiconductors in their natural state
are poor conductors because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current" title="Electric current">current</a> requires the flow of electrons, and semiconductors have their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_band" title="Valence band">valence bands</a> filled, preventing the entry flow of new electrons. There are several
developed techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like
conducting materials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)" title="Doping (semiconductor)">doping</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_effect_(semiconductor)" title="Field effect (semiconductor)">gating</a>. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type
and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively.
An unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow through the
material.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor#cite_note-Neamen-4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Heterojunctions</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterojunctions" title="Heterojunctions">Heterojunctions</a> occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined
together. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium" title="Germanium">germanium</a>. This
results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped
semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of
electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The
transfer occurs until equilibrium is reached by a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(physics)" title="Recombination (physics)">recombination</a>, which causes the migrating electrons
from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. A
product of this process is charged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion" title="Ion">ions</a>, which result in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field" title="Electric field">electric
field</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor#cite_note-Feynman-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor#cite_note-Neamen-4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Excited electrons</p>

<p>A difference in electric potential on
a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and
create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the
system, which interact via a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambipolar_diffusion" title="Ambipolar diffusion">ambipolar
diffusion</a>. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a
semiconducting material, the amount of holes and electrons changes. Such
disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a>, which can
enter the system and create electrons and holes. The process that creates and
annihilates electrons and holes are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_generation_and_recombination" title="Carrier generation and recombination">generation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_generation_and_recombination" title="Carrier generation and recombination">recombination</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor#cite_note-Neamen-4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Light emission</p>

<p>In certain semiconductors, excited
electrons can relax by emitting light instead of producing heat.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor#cite_note-5">[5]</a> These semiconductors are used in the construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" title="Light-emitting diode">light-emitting
diodes</a>and fluorescent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot" title="Quantum dot">quantum dots</a>.</p>
