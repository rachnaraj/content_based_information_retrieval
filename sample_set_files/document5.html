    As the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional
    to the product of their amounts, the product is in steady state nearly
    constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant
    electric field (which might "flush" carriers of both types, or move them
    from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or
    externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the
    temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce
a pair increases with temperature, being approximately exp(−<em>E</em>    <em><sub>G</sub></em>/<em>kT</em>), where <em>k</em> is

    , <em>T</em> is absolute temperature and <em>E</em><em><sub>G</sub></em> is
    band gap.
</p>
<p>
    The probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps—impurities or
    dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is
    completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the
    time needed to reach the steady state.
