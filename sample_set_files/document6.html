    The conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing
    impurities into their

    as <em>doping</em>. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an

    . By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical
    conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.

    A 1 cm<sup>3</sup> specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of
    10<sup>22</sup> atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free
    electron for conduction, thus 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of metal contains on the
    order of 10<sup>22</sup> free electrons, whereas a 1 cm<sup>3</sup> sample
    of pure germanium at 20 °C contains about 4.2×10<sup>22</sup> atoms, but
    only 2.5×10<sup>13</sup> free electrons and2.5×10<sup>13</sup> holes. The
addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 10    <sup>17</sup> free electrons in the same volume and the electrical
    conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.

    The materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of
    both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that
    produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron

. Semiconductors doped with <em>donor</em> impurities are called    <em>n-type</em>, while those doped with <em>acceptor</em>impurities are
    known as <em>p-type</em>. The n and p type designations indicate which
    charge carrier acts as the material's

    , which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration
    compared to the majority carrier.

For example, the pure semiconductor    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a>
    has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors.
In silicon, the most common dopants are <em>group III</em> and    <em>group V</em> elements. Group III elements all contain three valence
    electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon.
    When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant
    state ( an electron "hole") is created, which can move around the lattice
    and functions as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence
    electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms
    for silicon creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal
doped with    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron" title="Boron">boron</a>
    creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with
