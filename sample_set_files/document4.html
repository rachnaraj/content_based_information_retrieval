    The partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can
    be understood as adding electrons to that band. The electrons do not stay
    indefinitely (due to the natural thermal

    ) but they can move around for some time. The actual concentration of
    electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is
    possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a
    semiconductor as a sort of classical

    . In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic

    , and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field,
    etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different

    Because the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about
    conduction in very simplistic terms such as the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model" title="Drude model">
        Drude model
    </a>
    , and introduce concepts such as

    For partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to
    introduce the concept of an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole" title="Electron hole">

    . Although the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a
    completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current. If an
    electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the
    electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge. For the
    purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band,
    minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty
    band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as
    the electron. Combined with the <em>negative</em> effective mass of the
    electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a
    positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields
    just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with
    some positive effective mass.

    This particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence
    band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the
    electrons in the conduction band).
