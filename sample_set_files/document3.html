    Almost all of today's electronic technology involves the use of
    semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the

    </a>
    , etc. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal
    semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small
    imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material
    behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.

    A high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in
    crystal structure (such as

    ) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline
    faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the
    crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection.
Current mass production processes use crystal    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingot" title="Ingot">ingots</a>

    There is a combination of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting
    materials for ICs. One process is called
